    <h1>Spaghetti al Pomodoro</h1>

    <img src="/home/mariano/repos/odin-recipes/images/spaghetti.jpg">

    <p>This classic spaghetti al pomodoro recipe features the ultimate Italian tomato sauce, packed with flavor from great-quality tomatoes and basil.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg tomatoes, (sweet solanato or ripe cherry tomatoes work best).</li>
        <li>1 onion, roughly chopper.</li>
        <li>12 basil leaves.</li>
        <li>400g of spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Parmesan, or ricotta Salata, finely grated (optional).</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>salt, to taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin, cut a slit in the tomatoes (vertically) and place them in a pan with the chopped onion and a little salt. Squash them a little with a wooden spoon to get the juices out, then cook uncovered on a medium-low heat for 20â€“30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Discard any liquids that have accumulated on top by skimming off with a spoon. Scoop the cooked tomatoes and onions out of the pan and place in a vegetable mill. Process the pulp into a bowl. If you don't own a vegetable mill, blitz the tomatoes and onions in a blender then pass through a fine sieve.</li>
        <li>Place the tomato sauce back onto the heat and cook it again, uncovered, on a medium-low heat until it thickens.</li>
        <li>Add the torn basil leaves 5 minutes before it's ready and season with salt.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta al dente, following the instructions on the packet. Drain and mix in a serving bowl with the tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and finely grated Parmesan, if preferred.</li>
    </ol>
